Dutch ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±


## Installation

Add to your Gemfile

    $ bundle add laters

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install laters

## Usage

1. Include the `Laters::Concern` in your model
2. Call instance methods with `_later`

```rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Laters::Concern

  after_create_commit :notify_user_later
  after_commit :refresh_cache_later

  private

  def notify_user
    # External services
    Sms.send(to: user.phone, message: 'Hey!')
  end

  def refresh_cache!
    # Expensive calculation
  end
end
```

To set the queue to any other than the `default` set it like this:

```rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Laters::Concern

  run_in_queue :low
end
```

If you need callbacks, they are provided as standart model callbacks:

```rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Laters::Concern

  before_laters :do_something
  after_laters :do_something_more
  around_laters :do_something_around
  # Etc..
end
```
