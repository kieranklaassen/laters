# Laters ðŸ‘‹
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/laters.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/laters)

Run any instance_method of ActiveRecord models via a job by adding `_later` to it. Laters, means See you later in
Dutch ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

Compatible with Rails 5.0 through 8 and Ruby 3.0 through 3.4.


## Installation

Add to your Gemfile

    $ bundle add laters

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install laters

## Usage

1. Include the `Laters::Concern` in your model
2. Call instance methods with `_later`

```rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Laters::Concern

  after_create_commit :notify_user_later
  after_commit :generate_ai_summary_later

  private

  def notify_user
    # External services
    Sms.send(to: user.phone, message: 'Hey!')
  end

  def generate_ai_summary
    # Call Claude API to generate a summary asynchronously
    prompt = "Summarize this user profile: #{name}, #{bio}"
    
    response = AnthropicClient.complete(
      model: "claude-3-7-sonnet",
      prompt: prompt,
      max_tokens: 150
    )
    
    # Store the AI-generated summary
    update(ai_summary: response.completion)
  end
end
```

To set the queue to any other than the `default` set it like this:

```rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Laters::Concern

  run_in_queue :low
end
```

### Scheduling Options

You can use ActiveJob's scheduling options when calling methods with `_later`:

```rb
# Run 5 minutes from now
user.send_welcome_email_later(wait: 5.minutes)

# Run at a specific time
user.send_welcome_email_later(wait_until: 1.day.from_now)

# Set a priority (if supported by your queue adapter)
user.send_welcome_email_later(priority: 10)

# With method arguments
user.send_email_later('Welcome!', cc: admin@example.com, wait: 10.minutes)
```

### Callbacks

If you need callbacks, they are provided as standard model callbacks:

```rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Laters::Concern

  before_laters :do_something
  after_laters :do_something_more
  around_laters :do_something_around
  # Etc..
end
```
